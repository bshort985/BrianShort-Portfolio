# BrianShort-Portfolio

In this portfolio project I was to create a professional portfolio that a potential employer would want to see. With that in mind I created links to different future and current projects. Much of the site in functional however, work still need to be done the overall style. I really struggled getting the format to look like the mock-up and was not able to get all of it correct.

Work also need to be done the mobile formats as I was not able to get those completed as well. I cant understand why the page wont publish on live URL. I went through everything and couldn't find the issue.
